# The-Virtual-Patient
The Government of India wants to help medical students in rural areas who donâ€™t always have access to real patients. They are investing in a VR training system. A student puts on a headset, and suddenly they are sitting across the table from a patient. The patient might be calm, anxious, rude, or overly patient - just like in real life.
